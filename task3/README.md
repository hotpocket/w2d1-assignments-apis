# Using JSON.stringify() to seralize a json object
Create an Object literal in javascript and seralize it.


## Summary

There isn't much to tell here.  I hard coded an object literal, stored it in a variable, and passd it to JSON.stringify method.  It seemed to treat the object according to the rules of the JSON data encoding specification, insofar as the keys were double quoted.
